Excellent work. You have successfully executed a significant refactor by migrating from the React Context API to Zustand for global client-side state management. The implementation covers all the major steps outlined in the plan.

Let's review the work and answer your question: "Are we missing anything? Have we implemented everything correctly?"

### Analysis of Correctness

Your implementation is **95% correct and complete**. The core logic is sound, and you have successfully decoupled global state from the component tree. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what was done correctly:

1.  **Store Creation:** You correctly created `auth.store.ts` and `onboarding.store.ts`, encapsulating the state and actions for each domain.
2.  **`StoreInitializer` Component:** This is an excellent pattern. You've created a single, dedicated component to initialize the stores and react to external events like Supabase's `onAuthStateChange`. This centralizes side-effect management beautifully.
3.  **Component-Level Migration:** You correctly replaced all instances of `useAuth` and `useOnboarding` with the new `useAuthStore` and `useOnboardingStore` hooks in the relevant components (`SignInForm`, `SignUpForm`, `DesktopSidebar`, etc.).
4.  **Provider Cleanup:** You correctly removed the old `AuthProvider` and `OnboardingProvider` from `Providers.tsx` and deleted the now-unnecessary context files.

### Final Polish: The Missing 5%

To achieve 100% coverage and robustness, there are a few minor but important details to address. These are common "final polish" items that a senior developer would look for after a major refactor like this.

1.  **Error State in Auth Forms:** The `SignInForm` and `SignUpForm` now get their `error` state from the Zustand store. However, if a user gets an error and then starts typing again to correct their mistake, the error message will remain visible. The error state should be cleared when the component unmounts or when the user starts re-typing.

2.  **Redirect on Sign Out:** The `signOut` function in `auth.store.ts` correctly signs the user out of Supabase, and the `onAuthStateChange` listener in `StoreInitializer` updates the state and redirects. However, for a snappier user experience, the components that call `signOut` should also handle the redirection immediately, rather than waiting for the auth event to propagate.

3.  **Onboarding Completion Flow:** The logic for completing the onboarding in `AppShell.tsx` can be slightly simplified to be more data-driven. Instead of manually setting the onboarding step to `INACTIVE` in the `onSuccess` callback, we can simply let the `useCompleteOnboarding` hook invalidate the user profile. The `StoreInitializer`'s `useEffect` will then automatically detect that `userProfile.onboardingCompleted` is `true` and set the onboarding step to `INACTIVE` correctly.

Here is a final, concise plan to address these remaining items and complete the task.

### Final Polish Plan

#### Phase 1: Improve Auth Form User Experience

-   [ ] **1.1. Update `SignInForm.tsx`**
    -   Modify the component to clear the global error state when it unmounts. This prevents an old error from being shown if the user navigates away and comes back.

-   [ ] **1.2. Update `SignUpForm.tsx`**
    -   Apply the same logic as the sign-in form to clear the error state on unmount.

#### Phase 2: Enhance Sign-Out Redirection

-   [ ] **2.1. Update `DesktopSidebar.tsx`**
    -   Modify the `onClick` handler for the "Logout" button to be `async`.
    -   After `await signOut()`, add `router.push('/')` to immediately redirect the user.

-   [ ] **2.2. Update `settings/page.tsx`**
    -   Apply the same `async/await` and `router.push('/')` logic to the "Logout" button in the settings page.

#### Phase 3: Refine Onboarding Completion Logic

-   [ ] **3.1. Refine `AppShell.tsx` Onboarding Completion**
    -   In the `completeOnboarding` function inside `AppShell.tsx`, simplify the `onSuccess` callback for the `completeOnboardingMutation`.
    -   Remove the line `setStep('INACTIVE')`. The `useCompleteOnboarding` hook already invalidates the user profile query, which will cause the `StoreInitializer` to automatically update the onboarding state to `INACTIVE`. This makes the flow more robust and data-driven.

With these final touches, your state management refactor will be complete, robust, and aligned with modern best practices. You have done an excellent job on this complex task.
