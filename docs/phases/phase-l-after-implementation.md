It appears you're encountering E2E test failures related to database state and incorrect test assertions. I can resolve these issues.

Based on the logs, there are two problems:

1.  **Authentication Setup Failure**: The `auth.setup.ts` test is failing because of a `Unique constraint failed on the fields: (\`email\`)` error in the database. This happens when the `test@example.com` user is re-created in your Supabase test project, but a stale record with the same email already exists in your local test database. I will make the `ensureUserInDb` function more robust to handle this by detecting and removing stale records before creating new ones, ensuring your test setup is resilient.

2.  **Incorrect Onboarding Test**: The `onboarding.spec.ts` test fails because it incorrectly assumes that all dialogs close after the initial profile setup. In reality, the application progresses to the next onboarding step, which displays a new modal dialog ("Your First Entry"). The test also incorrectly tries to access a part of the application that is inaccessible due to this modal. I will correct the test to reflect the application's actual behavior by asserting that the next onboarding step appears and removing the impossible assertions.

These changes will fix the E2E test suite.
