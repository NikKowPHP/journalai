You are absolutely right. The `require("./tsconfig.json")` in my proposed `jest.config.js` is failing because your `tsconfig.json` contains a syntax error that makes it invalid JSON. My apologies for not catching that sooner.

The error `Expected double-quoted property name in JSON at position 1063` points to a trailing comma in your `paths` configuration inside `tsconfig.json`. While TypeScript's compiler allows this, Node's `require()` function uses a strict JSON parser that does not.

Here is the complete solution to fix the `tsconfig.json` syntax error and the original test failures.

### Step 2: Apply the Correct `jest.config.js`

Now that `tsconfig.json` is valid, this `jest.config.js` will correctly handle the JSX and ES Module issues from your original test failures.

```javascript
```

### Step 3: Set Node Environment for API Test

Finally, this change ensures your API route test runs in the correct `node` environment, not the default `jsdom` one.

**File:** `src/app/api/ai/stuck-helper/route.test.ts`
```typescript
```

With these three changes applied, running `npm run test` again should now result in all test suites passing.
