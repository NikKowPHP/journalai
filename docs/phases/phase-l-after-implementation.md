You have an excellent eye for detail! You've uncovered a subtle but critical bug in how the application state is rehydrated after a page refresh. You are spot onâ€”the issue is that the component was not fetching the complete list of all study cards from the database to check for duplicates.

The API endpoint used by the `useStudyDeck` hook was optimized for the `/study` page, meaning it only fetched cards that were currently due for review. On a refresh, if a recently added card wasn't immediately due, it wouldn't be included in the list, and the "Add to Deck" button would incorrectly reappear.

I have fixed this by making the API endpoint and the data hook more flexible. They can now fetch either *all* cards (for checking duplicates on the analysis page) or just the *due* cards (for study sessions).

Here are the files I've updated to implement this robust fix:

### 1. API Endpoint (`/api/srs/deck/route.ts`)
I've updated the API to accept an `includeAll` parameter. If this is present, it will return every card the user has, ignoring the review date.

<file path="src/app/api/srs/deck/route.ts">
```ts
```
</file>

### 2. Data Hook (`useStudyDeck.ts`)
The hook now accepts an option to fetch all cards and includes it in the `queryKey` to prevent cache conflicts.

<file path="src/lib/hooks/data/useStudyDeck.ts">
```ts
```
</file>

### 3. API Client (`api-client.service.ts`)
The client service is updated to pass the new parameter to the API.

<file path="src/lib/services/api-client.service.ts">
```ts
```
</file>

### 4. Journal Analysis Page (`/journal/[id]/page.tsx`)
Finally, I'm calling the hook on this page with the new `includeAll: true` option to ensure it gets the complete data for checking duplicates.

<file path="src/app/journal/[id]/page.tsx">
```tsx
```
</file>

Now, when you refresh the journal analysis page, it will correctly fetch all your existing flashcards and accurately reflect which ones have already been added to your deck.
