# **LinguaScribe: Static Codebase Implementation Master Plan (v3 - Consolidated)**

This document outlines the high-level plan for building the static UI for LinguaScribe. It is designed to be executed in large, autonomous phases.

## **The Plan**

### `[ ]` Phase A: Project Setup & UI Scaffolding
**Goal:** Execute all initial project setup, dependency installation, core layout adaptation, and scaffold all new LinguaScribe pages. The output will be a fully prepared codebase ready for feature component implementation.

*   [Detailed Steps](./docs/phases/phase-a-setup-and-scaffolding.md)

---
### `[ ]` Phase B: Component Implementation (By Epic)
**Goal:** Systematically build all new, static, reusable components required by the LinguaScribe epics, integrating them into the scaffolded pages from Phase A.

*   [Detailed Steps](./docs/phases/phase-b-component-implementation.md)

---
### `[ ]` Phase C: Theming & Visual Polish
**Goal:** Implement light/dark mode and conduct a full visual review to refine styling and ensure a cohesive look and feel across all new components.

*   [Detailed Steps](./docs/phases/phase-c-theming-and-polish.md)

---
### `[ ]` Phase D: Finalization & Handoff
**Goal:** Perform final code cleanup, add developer documentation, and prepare the static codebase for handoff to the backend integration phase.
