# Assistance Needed: Testing Blocked by Static Mode

**Phase:** Phase I - Testing & Deployment  
**Task:** I.1.1 - Test the "New User" Journey  
**Issue:**  

The testing tasks in Phase I require running the development server (`npm run dev`) to perform end-to-end manual testing. However, I'm currently operating in static-only mode which prohibits running development servers.

**Request:**  
Please either:
1. Switch me to a mode that allows running the development server for testing, or
2. Perform the manual testing steps yourself and provide me with the results

**Blocked Tasks:**
- I.1.1: Test the "New User" Journey
- I.1.2: Test the "Core Loop" (Write & Analyze)  
- I.1.3: Test the "Study Loop" (SRS)
- I.1.4: Test the "Monetization" Journey

Once testing is complete, I can proceed with the remaining deployment preparation tasks.
