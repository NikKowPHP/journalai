# Assistance Required: Missing Master Plan File

**Issue:** The `docs/master_plan.md` file does not exist in the project directory. This file is required by the development protocol to track phase completion and proceed with the project.

**Impact:** 
- Cannot mark Phase L as completed
- Cannot proceed to next phases
- Violates the hierarchical autonomous loop protocol

**Requested Action:**
Please provide the `master_plan.md` file or create it in the `docs` directory with the proper phase structure.
